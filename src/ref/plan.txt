Ok so how can we actually simulate this stuff?

First, let's pick how we want a circuit to be formatted. I think it mases sense
for a "circuit" object to be a vector for elements in series, and containing
vectors for elements in parallel. For example, a circuit that has a battery,
then a resistor, then two resistors in parallel, then another resistor, would
appear as:

Circuit = [bat, r1, [r2, r3], r4]

Second, let's figure out how we can actually solve this system. It should be
a method that can find the state of the circuit at any time, not just the
steady-state conditions.

Maybe first let's break each section into Kirchoff loops, so that we can
examine each individually. Doing so for this example would yeild:

Loop_1 = [bat, r1, r2, r4]
Loop_2 = [bat, r1, r3, r4]

Now each of these circuits can be solved entirely independly of each other,
and then the results added together at the end.

In the case that all the elements are resistors, we are pretty much done
because we can find the equivalent resistance and then solve. But if
one of the elements is an inductor or capacitor then we hasve problems.

Maybe the best options is to find the dV contribution from each one, and
because we know the current has to be the same through all the elements
we can then solve for the current.

So, for the first loop, we would have

0 = dVb - dVr1 - dVr2 - dVr4
0 = dVb - IR1 - IR2 - IR4

And then we can interatively solve for I, and likewise for the second loop.

Now consider if our circuit was an LRC circuit.

Circuit = [bat, r, l, c]

Now there are no loops so that makes it easy, and we have

0 = dVb - IR - (dI/dt)L - (I dt)C

At the beginning, dI/dt and I dt are both 0 so they don't contribute any dV.
On the next time step, we then calculate dI/dt and I dt and use those instead.
